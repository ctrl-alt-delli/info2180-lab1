        <p>Hi! I am a student at UWI Mona, studying Electronics and Computer Science. 
	Outside of school, I enjoy reading, listening to music, trying different foods 
	and learning different languages. My interest in Web Development began with a
	course I took last semester in which I had to make hardware circuits and create
	 webpages to inferface with these circuits. This course sparked my interest for 
	Web Development and helped me realize that I enjoy creating interactive websites 
	that people can use and that can serve as an outlet for my creativity.</p>
